# ONRAMP-WEEK-FOUR

This challenge is designed to test your HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

Your challenge is to build out a sign-up form complete with client-side validation using JavaScript and get it looking as close to the design component in the utils/design folder as possible.

Check the wiki tab on git for the assessment workflow (a guide on how to setup git for version control on the project).

Get colors, fonts etc from the utils/style-guide.md file.

All code should be written in the `/src` folder.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


Happy coding!
